# JavaProgrammingFinalProject

Your team assignment is to write a console-based application that will serve as a course
registration system. You can imagine that the system will be used by a local college to
register students for courses and also for students to self-register. The data for the
registration system should be stored in one or more text files.
System Requirements
At a minimum, your registration system should contain three screens:
        • A screen that shows the list of courses available and the ability to register for
one,
        • A registration status screen that denotes either success or failure upon
registration, and
        • A student profile page that shows a list of classes that the student is already
registered for.

Also, dependent upon your system design, you may find a login screen beneficial.
The system should provide several features:
        • The ability for students to view an alphabetical list of courses that includes the
limit, and the number of students already enrolled.
        • The ability for students to register or un-register for a course.
        • The ability for a student to see a list of classes for which he/she is currently
registered.

There are several business rules:
        • The system should not allow a student to register for a course that has already
reached its max enrollment limit.
        • The system should not allow one student to view the registration information for
another student.
        • The system should not allow a student to un-register from a course for which
he/she is not registered.
The data for your system should be stored in text files. The amount of text files needed
is based on your system design; however, at a minimum, after a student successfully
registers, the registration information should be stored in a file.
